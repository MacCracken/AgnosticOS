| **2026-03-28** | AgnosAI benchmarks (4/5 wins vs CrewAI, 2000-4500x faster cached). Release `2026.3.29` |
| **2026-03-31** | **First fully clean release** (`2026.3.31`). All 17 artifacts built successfully — x86_64 ISO (desktop + minimal + edge), aarch64 SD card images (desktop + minimal + edge), userland tarballs, multi-arch Docker container. First release with zero build failures across all architectures. 80 shared crates (45 at v1.0+). 3 new science crates scaffolded (mastishk, rasayan, varna). 336 commits, 19 tagged releases |
| **2026-04-01** | **Monolith dismantled**. agent-runtime, ai-shell, llm-gateway, desktop-environment removed from workspace. 12 standalone repos extracted. 3 crate absorptions (bote 0.91.0, kavach 2.0.0, t-ron 0.90.0). Named subsystems: edge→seema, scheduler→samay. Crypto boundary resolved: sigil owns all AGNOS trust/crypto |
| **2026-04-02** | **Sigil 1.0.0** — first trust crate stable. Bote 0.91.0 — MCP 2025-11-25 spec compliance. **agnosticos.org** domain registered, coming-soon site deployed. 77 shared crates (56 at v1.0+). 95+ marketplace recipes |

| **2026-04-04** | **Cyrius 1.0** — self-hosting compiler (29KB seed, 42ms bootstrap). Bootstrap loop closed. 44 programs, 58KB kernel (VM, processes, syscalls). Beats GNU on size (10-233x) and speed (wc 2.4x faster). 141 tests, 0 failures |
| **2026-04-05** | **Cyrius ecosystem** — 35 stdlib modules, 8 developer tools, 5 Rust crate rewrites (agnostik, agnosys, kybernet, nous, ark), aarch64 cross-compiler, 38 benchmarks, CI/CD pipelines. 186 tests, dual architecture. Day 3 and counting |
| **2026-05-15** | **Iron boot — MVP spine alive on archaemenid**. After a multi-burn repair ladder, `gnoboot` v0.1.0 (sovereign UEFI loader) hands off to `agnos` 1.30.1, which completes its full init spine on real hardware: GDT/TSS/IDT → APIC + timer → paging → PMM → heap → ACPI/PCI → VFS → initrd → SYSCALL → scheduler arming → idle survival → userland exec → kybernet-launch. Closed-beta gate (cp_fb 0x11 MAGENTA) re-held; four more checkpoints painted past it. The mem-iso block collapsed when a repair deleted the 303-line post-MVP verification test per `uefi-boot-prior-art.md` §6 — turned out to be a detour through a test that wasn't on the boot critical path. |

## Development Pace

AGNOS went from initial commit to first bootable ISO in **39 days** (2026-02-11 to 2026-03-22), and from first ISO to first fully clean multi-architecture release in **48 days** (2026-02-11 to 2026-03-31).

From first commit to sovereign self-hosting language with its own kernel in **53 days** (2026-02-11 to 2026-04-04).

The Cyrius language went from nothing to a self-hosting compiler with a kernel in **one day** (2026-04-04), and through major-version cuts (1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0 → 4.0 → 5.0) reaching the v5.x stdlib-foldin cycle (sandhi v5.7.0, vani v5.8.0, niyama v5.9.0) by week 12, then the **REAL TYPE SYSTEM arc** at v5.10.x (24 patches in 2 days). The AGNOS kernel hardened from 143KB (with 14 buffer overflows — "The 143KB Lie") through 220KB (v1.21.0) → 260KB (v1.22.0) → 248KB (v1.26.1), then past 1 MB through the 1.3x–1.4x storage / networking / filesystem / exec-from-disk / shell-separation arcs, and on through the 1.5x graphics / audio / FP arcs to **agnos 1.53.5** — base kernel-internals essentially complete — then straight into the kernel graphics stack: GPU compute on archaemenid's Cezanne shader cores with no amdgpu and no ROCm (1.54.x), display/scanout plus a sovereign ATOM BIOS interpreter and **ACPI S5 self-poweroff** (1.55.x), and shaders → a GPU triangle rasteriser → perspective-correct texturing → native-resolution modeset (1.56.x), arriving 2026-08-03 at **the aethersafha desktop compositing two real client windows on iron**. Live kernel head, binary size and Cyrius pins are in [`docs/development/state.md`](development/state.md). 40+ subsystems ported from Rust to Cyrius, each measured against its Rust predecessor.

The shared crate ecosystem spans a large registry of crates (most at v1.0+ stable) — see [`docs/applications/libs/README.md`](applications/libs/README.md) for the live count — with consumer applications developed in parallel.

| Cyrius v5.8.x — **66 patches in 4 days** (3-phase: audit closeout, language vocabulary, stdlib foldin sweep with vani-fold at slot 1) | 2026-05-01 → 2026-05-05 | 79–83 |
| **Cyrius v5.9.0 cut — niyama-fold opener** (8th sibling distfile, 5 regex engines, 6,664 lines vendored). cc5 binary at 741,048 B | 2026-05-06 | 84 |
| **Beta rescoped — two-stage**: closed beta (13A + friend-tester cohort) + public beta (adds independent verification + community testing); ADR-008 catch-up records the Cyrius pivot. *(Dates later re-scoped — closed beta → late August 2026 after a founder solo-dogfood month, public beta deferred post-summer; see Target rows below.)* | 2026-05-06 | 84 |
| **Cyrius v5.9.x close — 44 patches over 3 days** (catchup + niyama-fold cycle); pin-lag bands collapse — agnosys/vyakarana/sandhi/cyim/agnostik/owl all roll forward; aegis graduates 0.1.0 → 0.8.2; **darshana** extracted from cyim's TTY layer when chakshu became second consumer | 2026-05-08 | 87 |
| **Cyrius v5.10.x — REAL TYPE SYSTEM arc** opens with per-phase compile-time profiling instrumentation (v5.10.0), pivots at v5.10.5 to type vocabulary (cstring / Result / Option / Tagged) and call-site type checking (Phase 2 at v5.10.24); 24 patches in 2 days. cc5 binary at 783,408 B (+42 KB). Bare-metal + RISC-V rv64 reservation slips to v5.12.x; v5.11.x reserved for TS testing suite + bug sweep | 2026-05-08 → 2026-05-09 | 87–88 |
| **Iron boot — MVP spine alive on archaemenid** (NUC AMD Beelink SER). Path C sovereign UEFI (`gnoboot`) hands off to `agnos` 1.30.1 via the sovereign boot-info struct at RDI; kernel completes its full init spine on real hardware — GDT/TSS/IDT, APIC + timer, paging, PMM, heap, ACPI/PCI enumeration, VFS, initrd, SYSCALL, stack canary, scheduler arming (closed-beta gate cp_fb 0x11 MAGENTA re-held), userland exec test, kybernet-launch site. Four checkpoints past the closed-beta gate. The mem-iso ladder closed when a repair deleted the offending 303-line test block per `uefi-boot-prior-art.md` §6. Closes the "boots-on-iron" front; remaining work to typeable-shell MVP is fb glyph renderer + PS/2-emulation verification for USB keyboards. | 2026-05-15 | 93 |
| **MVP GATE HIT — typeable shell on iron** (agnos 1.30.9). Closed-beta MVP (kernel + kybernet + agnoshi typeable on archaemenid) clears after the xhci silent-absorb arc closed (ending at cyrius v5.11.64's gvar-init-order fix; root cause was an upstream cyrius bug, not silicon) | 2026-05-18 | 96 |
| **Cyrius v6.0.0 cycle-open + two-binary rename ceremony**: `cc5` → `cycc` (production), `cyrc` → `cybs` (bootstrap); v5.11.x closes at **5.11.69** — 70 patches across 11 days, longest minor in Cyrius history | 2026-05-19 | 97 |
| **kashi extracted** (काशि — AGNOS console-font subsystem; freestanding VGA 8x16 + CGA 8x8 glyph cores split from `fb_console.cyr` for parallel-agent development). v1.0+ binaries cohort jumps to 13 with sys-info + terminal-aesthetics burst (mihi/iam/chakshu/bannermanor/darshana/hapi) | 2026-05-20 | 98 |
| **Storage arc (agnos 1.31.x) CLOSED** — all 5 block backends + GPT + ext2/ext4 read landed with iron debuts: NVMe, AHCI/SATA, USB-MS, RAM-disk + VirtIO-blk modern all iron-validated, ext2/ext4 read 1.31.5 + 64BIT 1.31.7 | 2026-05-22 | 100 |
| **r8169 unicast-RX delivery arc CLOSED at 1.32.7** (`missed` collapsed 176 → 0 via RX-ring deepen 16 → 64). **Networking-iron-COMPLETE at 1.32.9** (DHCP `.142` real lease on archaemenid) | 2026-05-25 | 103 |
| **W5 demo→base iron burn PASS** (agnos 1.33.1) — `persist.txt` survives reboot on unmodified default `mkfs.ext4`; **demo→base maturity exit on real NAND**. `fsync` FLUSH-CACHE barrier at 1.33.5 | 2026-05-26 | 104 |
| **FAT-family arc COMPLETE** (1.34.0–1.34.6 across FAT12/16/32 + exFAT read+write + LFN + dir growth + Unicode names + ESP-write guard; `fsck`-clean in QEMU). **1.35.x networking-comms arc COMPLETE** (DNS + ICMP + TCP hardening B0-B4 + NTP + anonymous mmap/munmap + RTC boot clock + DNS cache + arc-close hardening). **1.36.x refactor cycle COMPLETE** (net.cyr split, main.cyr selftest extraction). **1.37.x ext4 extent-allocation arc OPENS** | 2026-05-27 | 105 |
| **ext4 extent allocation iron-validated** (agnos 1.37.3 depth-2 PASS + e2fsck-clean on real NVMe). **1.37.5 arc-close: kashi 0.6.0 vendored into kernel** (retires inline glyph tables). **kashi v1.0.0 API freeze** later same day. **1.38.x JBD2 journaling arc COMPLETE in a single day** — 9 bites: probe → probe-deepen → log reader → replay → lifecycle → write path → integration → crash smoke → hardening + iron-burn audit. AGNOS now both *consumes* Linux-left journals AND *produces* its own; sync-checkpoint with 3 FLUSH-CACHE barriers; `jbd2-crash-smoke.sh` 4/4 e2fsck-clean across SIGKILL points | 2026-05-28 | 106 |
| **JBD2 crash-safe journaling iron-validated** (1.38.10 — CSUM_V3 write-side commit + 100-tx crash stress + mid-cycle power-cut recovery, host `e2fsck -fn` clean throughout). **1.39.x VFS generic-write lift COMPLETE** (FAT/exFAT shell verbs + subdir paths + mount-namespace routing). | 2026-05-30 | 108 |
| **🎯 exec-from-disk iron-validated — base-maturity exec leg closed on real Zen** (`/bin/prog2` + `/bin/argv` run in ring 3, `run: exit 42`/`90`). A single iron boot validated the whole 1.40.x arc — exec (1.40.9) + scheduler-reset fix (1.40.10) + boot-stack relocation (1.40.12) + VFS mount routing (1.40.13): FAT shell verbs pass with ext2 at `/`, clean boot past scheduler to kybernet. **1.40.14 process teardown/reaping.** **1.41.0 shell-separation arc OPENS** (interactive shell → userland `agnoshi`; cyrius-gated `CYRIUS_TARGET_AGNOS` syscall-ABI prereq). | 2026-05-31 | 109 |
| **Shell-separation arc software-complete (agnos 1.41.1 → 1.41.11)** — the interactive shell left the kernel: `kybernet` now execs `/bin/agnsh` in ring 3, and the in-kernel shell shrank to a recovery-only REPL (`shell.cyr` 1149 → 813 LOC at 1.41.9). The `CYRIUS_TARGET_AGNOS` leap (pin 6.0.14 → 6.0.56 at 1.41.4) landed `args_agnos`/`process_agnos` so `agnsh` could run; FS syscall group (getdents/unlink/rename/link/stat) brought the surface to 0-33 (34 calls) at 1.41.3. **Permanent kernel↔userland boundary locked.** QEMU-validated (sweep.sh 7/7, fssys ALL PASS, shsys ALL PASS, agnsh-smoke PASS, check.sh 11/11). **Iron burn PENDING** (first hardware validation of the arc staged with the A1-A4 rubric; not yet booted on real hardware). | 2026-06-04 | 113 |
| **Shell-separation iron-validated — `agnoshi` (ring-3 shell from disk) runs on archaemenid.** The A1–A4 rubric burn cleared: the interactive shell now runs in ring 3, loaded from disk, on real Zen. | 2026-06 | — |
| **1.4x graphics + DOOM in-game on iron** — framebuffer glyph/graphics path and the DOOM engine run in-game on real hardware. | 2026-06 | — |
| **Multi-threading + preemptive scheduling + SMP iron-validated** — preemptive round-robin across cores on real hardware. | 2026-06 | — |
| **1.52.x HDA audio arc — DOOM-WITH-SOUND on iron** — the HDA/Azalia driver drives DOOM audio out the analog front jack on archaemenid. | 2026-07 | — |
| **1.53.x kernel FP/SIMD arc — real f64 in ring 3 on iron** — per-process XMM state; `f64`/SIMD DSP validated on real Zen. **agnos 1.53.5 — base kernel-internals essentially complete.** | 2026-07 | — |
| **Kernel GPU-compute arc (1.54.x) — opened and closed in four days.** From the first write to archaemenid's AMD Cezanne iGPU (PSP GPCOM ring-create) through PSP firmware load, GFXHUB GMC setup and the first PM4 packet + doorbell, to hand-assembled gfx90c shaders running integer tiled matmul (1.54.29) and full-precision f64 matmul (1.54.31) with **no amdgpu and no ROCm** — the f64 result **bit-identical to rosnet's CPU math including rounding** (1.54.32). Exposed to ring 3 at `#82` / `#83 gpu_dispatch_f64` | 2026-07-11 → 2026-07-14 | 150–153 |
| **★ AGNOS POWERS ITSELF OFF — ACPI S5, iron-validated** (1.55.26): the full S5 sequence from the agnsh prompt, power LED out on archaemenid, `_S5_` read live off the AMI DSDT. Same day the **sovereign ATOM BIOS interpreter is PROVEN ON IRON** (1.55.24) — VBIOS from the ACPI VFCT table; encoder and transmitter runs emit *exactly* the amdgpu oracle's write sequences | 2026-07-19 | 158 |
| **First hardware 2D on agnos** — CP-DMA copy, fill and true strided blit all verified on iron in one boot (1.55.30), the blit's inter-row padding untouched. The next day the **GPU compositor seam `#86`–`#89` is IRON-PROVEN: a whole mock compositor frame with zero per-pixel CPU work** (1.55.32), closing the display arc as the 1.56.x shader arc opens | 2026-07-21 → 2026-07-22 | 160–161 |
| **agnos has a GPU triangle rasteriser** (1.56.17) — 167 hand-authored gfx90c instructions, **20 of 20 cases byte-identical** to the CPU reference on iron with every negative control firing. The rung ladder then closed barycentric RGBA, texturing, bilinear, depth test, and **perspective-correct texturing** (1.56.31) — the last proven on a corpus where the affine and perspective references differ at 731 of 1541 covered pixels | 2026-07-25 → 2026-07-29 | 164–168 |
| **⭐ THE DESKTOP COMPOSITES TWO REAL CLIENT WINDOWS ON IRON.** archaemenid boots to `smp: cpus online: 4` and the aethersafha compositor hosts `present_probe` and **crab's dual-pane file manager** as windows on the panel — 278 frames, keys delivered to the client, clean Esc quit. The blocker was one line (agnos 1.56.35): the AP trampoline set `EFER \|= 0x100` (LME only) where the BSP sets `0x900` (LME\|NXE), so bit 63 of every NX paging entry was RESERVED and each W^X data page faulted on an AP. Cross-CPU TLB shootdown landed in the same cut | 2026-08-03 | 173 |
| **Native 2560x1440 scanout + a hardware-panned boot console — RELEASED and BURNED PASS** (1.56.36 / 1.56.37 / 1.56.38): the scaler in DSCL bypass, no banded first frame, and a modeset latch that releases itself at clean shutdown. `Timer ticks before sched` 28 (800x600) → 149 (native, software scroll) → **11** (native + pan) | 2026-08-03 → 2026-08-04 | 173–174 |
| **Kernel head agnos 1.56.40 — OPEN, not burned**: the local-IPC **channel band** (`chan_*`), replacing TCP-on-loopback, retired 2026-08-03 as the *wrong primitive* for local display IPC — ⚠ retired as wrong, **not** as a thing that never worked. Decisions closed the same day: `#96` = `fork`, `#97` = `chan_op`, no codename. Live versions, sizes and pins → [`state.md`](development/state.md) | 2026-08-05 | 175 |
| **Target: Closed beta cut** (after a ~July founder solo-dogfood month) | **late August 2026** | — |
| **Target: Public beta** | **deferred post-summer 2026** | — |
| **Target: GA** | **late fall / early winter 2026** | — |

## Compiler Binary Naming

The Cyrius compiler binary has been renamed four times over the language's evolution. Each rename created drift across scripts, CI, install paths, and docs — which motivates the final rename to `cycc` at v6.0 to end the treadmill by decoupling binary name from language version.

| Binary | Cyrius era | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| `cc` | v1.x | Initial self-hosting compiler (2026-04-04) |
| `cc2` | v2.x | First rename (v2.0, ~2026-04-08) |
| `cc3` | v3.x and v4.x | Stayed across both major versions (v3.0 shipped ~2026-04-09; persisted through v4.8.x on 2026-04-14) |
| `cc5` | v5.x | `cc3` → `cc5` at v5.0.0 (2026-04-15) — **cc4 was never shipped**; that binary name/version was skipped |
| `cycc` | v6.x (current) | `cc5` → `cycc` ("Cyrius Computer Compiler") at v6.0.0 ceremony on 2026-05-19. Bootstrap `cyrc` → `cybs` ("Cyrius Bootstrap") in the same ceremony. **Names are now permanent** — no `cycc7` at v7.0.0; the cc3 → cc5 (v5.0.0) → cycc (v6.0.0) sequence was the LAST name-change penalty paid |

Four renames total across four language-major transitions. The `cc5` → `cycc` event at v6.0 (landed 2026-05-19) is the one-and-done cleanup that future major versions inherit without further renaming. Back-compat symlinks `cc5 → cycc` + `cyrc → cybs` shipped through the v6.0.x window and were dropped at v6.1.0; `~/.cyrius/bin/` now carries `cycc` and `cybs` only.
