## What It Does

- **Microbial growth**: Exponential/logistic curves, Monod kinetics, doubling time, growth phases, chemostat models
- **Metabolism**: Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, Lineweaver-Burk plots, metabolic pathways, ATP yield, fermentation
- **Genetics**: Mutation rates, horizontal gene transfer, selection coefficients, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, codon table, GC content
- **Epidemiology**: SIR/SEIR compartmental models, R₀ calculation, herd immunity thresholds, epidemic trajectories
- **Biofilm**: Attachment/dispersal stages, quorum sensing, nutrient diffusion (Fick's law), biofilm growth models
- **Antibiotic resistance**: MIC lookup, kill curves, resistance transfer rates, antibiotic classes
- **Taxonomy**: Domain/Gram stain/cell shape/oxygen requirement classification

## Consumers

- **sangha** — epidemiological models feed social dynamics simulation
- **kimiya** — biochemistry overlap (enzyme kinetics, metabolic reactions)
- **kiran/joshua** — ecosystem simulation, disease mechanics in game worlds
