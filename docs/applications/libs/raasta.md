## What It Does

- A* pathfinding with customizable heuristics and cost functions
- HPA* (Hierarchical Pathfinding A*) for large-scale maps with precomputed clusters
- Navigation mesh generation and query for 3D environments
- Spatial navigation with obstacle avoidance and steering behaviors
- Grid, graph, and navmesh representations with unified query API

## Consumers

- **kiran** — Game engine (entity navigation, AI movement)
- **joshua** — Game manager (NPC navigation and patrol routes)

## Architecture

- Generic over graph type via trait-based abstraction
- Built on hisab spatial structures (BVH, k-d tree) for acceleration
