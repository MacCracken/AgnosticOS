# CIS Benchmarks — AGNOS Mapping

**Last Updated**: 2026-08-05

> **This is a mapping, not an attestation.** AGNOS holds **no CIS certification**, and none is claimed. No compliance percentage has been measured against the AGNOS kernel. AGNOS is **Pre-Beta** (agnos 1.56.40 / cyrius 6.5.7 / gnoboot 0.6.1 at the time of writing). Consistent with the compliance table in [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md), CIS is 📋 **Planned**.

The CIS Distribution Independent Linux Benchmark is written for a **Linux distribution**. Every one of its six sections presupposes a subsystem AGNOS does not have: uid/gid separation and `/etc/passwd`, PAM, systemd, `/etc/fstab` mount options, sysctl, auditd, rsyslog, TCP wrappers, iptables/nftables, and an apt/dnf-shaped package manager. AGNOS has none of them, and per [`docs/development/roadmap.md`](../development/roadmap.md) it is not going to grow them — confinement, when it lands, is "**capability-scoped and native** — never Landlock, seccomp or `unshare` ABI emulation."

So most of this document's predecessor was not *stale*. It was **categorically inapplicable**, and it marked ~55 controls ✅ against subsystems that do not exist. That is an audit liability, and it has been removed rather than updated.

## Status vocabulary

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ **Shipped** | Verified in live source at the cited `path:line` |
| 🐧 **Linux-target only** | Real, but only on a Linux build target or the Linux **host-bootstrap** kernel. **Not an AGNOS control** |
| 📋 **Aspirational** | Intended; no mechanism exists today |
| ❌ **Absent** | No mechanism, and no CIS-shaped analogue |

## Two different targets — do not conflate them

1. **The AGNOS kernel** — a single Cyrius binary. There are **no loadable kernel modules** and no LSM framework. This is what "AGNOS" means below, and it is what CIS is being mapped against.
2. **Linux host-bootstrap kernels** — `kernel/{6.6-lts,6.x-stable,7.0-devel}/configs/agnos_defconfig` and `kernel/configs/edge-*.config`. These build the *host* used to stage AGNOS. Their `CONFIG_*` rows are real, but they say nothing about AGNOS. They are marked 🐧 throughout.

⚠️ Neither of those Linux configs is consumed by a live pipeline. Their only consumers repo-wide are `scripts/archive-pre-cyrius/build-kernel.sh:160` and `.github/archive-pre-cyrius/selfhost-build.yml:865-866` — both **archived Rust-era** artifacts. The Cyrius boot pipeline (`scripts/src/boot.cyr`) has no kernel-config step.

## Control-family mapping

Verdict key: **(a)** maps directly · **(b)** maps to a different AGNOS mechanism · **(c)** does not apply.

### 1.1 Filesystem Configuration

| CIS intent | Verdict | AGNOS reality | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/etc/fstab` mount options (`noexec`, `nosuid`, `nodev`, separate `/tmp`) | **(c)** ❌ | There is no `/etc/fstab` and no mount-option enforcement. `mount#11` and `umount#24` are **no-op stubs that return 0** | `agnos/kernel/core/syscall.cyr:7191,7193` |
| The *intent* behind `noexec` — data must not be executable | **(b)** ✅ | Enforced **per page, not per mount**: W^X maps every non-`PF_X` PT_LOAD segment, every user stack, and all `sys_mmap` anonymous memory NX (bit 63) | `agnos/kernel/core/proc.cyr:1021-1046` · `core/elf.cyr:126,156` |
| — caveat on the above | ⚠️ | NX only *means* anything if `EFER.NXE` is set, and **it is set — but only the APs assert it.** Each secondary CPU's trampoline writes `EFER = LME\|NXE` explicitly (`smp.cyr:542-552`, after an `-smp 4` reserved-bit `#PF` proved the omission). The **BSP** on the shipping ELF64/UEFI path writes EFER nowhere — the branch that would (`boot_shim.cyr:98-99`) is under `#ifndef ELF64_KERNEL` and `agnos/scripts/build.sh:187` defines that macro, so it is dead code; the live path's header says "CR0/CR3/CR4/EFER — UEFI configured them." NXE is therefore **inherited from firmware on the BSP and never verified**. It has in fact been observed set — EFER read back `0xd00` on two independent live boots, once as an NX stack fault actually firing — so W^X **is enforced today**. The gap is the missing assertion: firmware that left NXE clear would void W^X silently, with no boot-time error | `agnos/kernel/arch/x86_64/smp.cyr:542-552` · `boot_shim.cyr:98-99,184` · `ring3.cyr:127` · `syscall_hw.cyr:201-202` |
| Sticky bit on `/tmp` (1777) | **(c)** ❌ | Requires a permission model. ext2 preserves `i_mode` on disk, but the kernel enforces nothing against it — there is no uid to check and no `chmod` syscall | `agnos/kernel/core/ext2.cyr:231` · `core/syscall.cyr:7190` |
| Disable USB storage | **(c)** ❌ **inverted** | USB mass storage is a **compiled-in kernel driver AGNOS can boot from**, not a removable module. There is no config knob to disable it | `agnos/kernel/core/block.cyr:32,94,125,168` · `arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr` |
| Disable FireWire / Thunderbolt / automount | 🐧 | `CONFIG_FIREWIRE=n`, `CONFIG_THUNDERBOLT=n`, `CONFIG_AUTOMOUNT=n` are present in the **host** defconfig. AGNOS has no such drivers to begin with | `kernel/6.6-lts/configs/agnos_defconfig:107,111,101` |

⚠️ The predecessor claimed `CONFIG_TMPFS_XATTR=n` and `CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE=n`. **Both symbols are absent from every host defconfig.**

### 1.2 / 2.2 Legacy and special-purpose services

**(c) Does not apply — and "compliant" here would be vacuous.** CIS asks you to disable xinetd/rsh/telnet/ftp/tftp/avahi/CUPS/LDAP/NFS/Samba/Dovecot/SNMP. AGNOS ships **no package set at all**, so none of them is present — not because a control removed them, but because nothing installed them. Marking that ✅ tells a reviewer a decision was made where none was.

Two rows are worth stating plainly because AGNOS's actual behaviour **contradicts** the CIS intent:

- **Telnet.** AGNOS ships **agora**, a telnet-served BBS whose default listener is port **2323** (`agora/src/main.cyr:36`). CIS 1.2.3 says no telnet; an AGNOS operator running agora is deliberately not complying.
- **HTTP server.** A running AGNOS system serves HTTP from its own daemons — daimon on `0.0.0.0:8090` (`daimon/src/server.cyr:183`, `src/config.cyr:11`), hoosh on `127.0.0.1:8088` (`hoosh/src/main.cyr:77,83`), and bote's four MCP transports across `127.0.0.1:8390-8393` when explicitly launched — HTTP 8390 and bridge 8391 in `bote/src/main.cyr:143-158`, plus the sibling binaries `bote-streamable` on 8392 (`src/main_streamable.cyr:59`) and `bote-ws` on 8393 (`src/main_ws.cyr:47`). CIS 2.2.9 says no HTTP server.

The honest control here is not a disable-list; it is the enumerated listening set and its caveats in [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) § *Network Security*. ⚠️ **There is no firewall** — no netfilter, no nftables, no packet-filter hook anywhere in the AGNOS kernel — so a port is closed only because no program opened it.

### 2.1 Time Synchronization

**(b) Maps to a different mechanism.** No chrony, no systemd-timesyncd, no systemd at all — PID 1 is **kybernet** (1.4.0). AGNOS instead has a **kernel-native SNTP client**: `agnos/kernel/core/net_ntp.cyr`.

✅ Shipped, with the scope its own header declares: RFC 4330 simple unicast, one UDP/123 query, "no offset calc, no drift discipline" (`net_ntp.cyr:6-7`). ⚠️ **It is unauthenticated** — a grep for auth/NTS/key material in `net_ntp.cyr` returns nothing. CIS's underlying intent (time comes from a *trusted* source) is **not** met; only the sync itself is.

### 3.1 / 3.2 Network parameters (sysctl)

**(c) Does not apply to AGNOS.** There is no sysctl subsystem, no `/proc/sys`, and no `/etc/sysctl.d` in the AGNOS kernel.

🐧 `config/sysctl/99-agnos-hardening.conf` exists in this repo and is a correct CIS 3.1/3.2 fragment **for a Linux host**. ⚠️ Nothing deploys it today: its only writers are `scripts/archive-pre-cyrius/build-installer.sh:552-554` and `build-sdcard.sh:553-555` (archived bash), applied by `config/init/agnos-init.sh:163-164` under a **systemd unit** (`config/systemd/system/agnos-init.service:10`). AGNOS runs kybernet, not systemd. The predecessor's claim that it is "deployed during OS installation" is false for **agnova**, the installer that ships.

What the AGNOS network stack does have, verified, is narrower and worth naming for what it is rather than mapping onto a sysctl row:

| Control | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ingress length hardening — a claimed IPv4 total-length is clamped to bytes actually received | ✅ Shipped | `agnos/kernel/core/net_ingress.cyr:182` |
| TCP ISN unpredictability (RDRAND-seeded, timer-LCG XOR fallback) | ✅ Shipped | `agnos/kernel/core/net_tcp.cyr:411-415` |
| SYN cookies, rp_filter, redirect/source-route policy, martian logging | ❌ Absent | No equivalent knob or code path exists |

### 3.3 TCP Wrappers

**(c) ❌ Does not apply.** No libwrap, no `/etc/hosts.allow`, no `/etc/hosts.deny`, and no packet filter to substitute for them.

### 3.4 Uncommon network protocols (DCCP / SCTP / RDS / TIPC)

**(a) Maps — and this is the one family where AGNOS's answer is structurally stronger than the control asks.**

CIS asks you to disable four protocol modules. AGNOS has **no protocol-family selector to disable**. The network band is a fixed set of purpose-built syscalls over one kernel TCP/UDP/ICMP stack — `sock_connect#47`, `sock_send#48`, `sock_recv#49`, `sock_close#50`, `udp_bind#51`…`icmp_echo#55`, `sock_listen#56`, `sock_accept#57` — none of which takes an address-family or protocol argument (`agnos/kernel/core/syscall.cyr:42-43`). There is no generic BSD socket family, no `socket()` over arbitrary domains, no `splice`, no `AF_ALG`. This is the same property that makes the kernel structurally immune to CVE-2026-31431; see [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) § *Notable Hardening*.

⚠️ State it precisely. **AGNOS does have sockets** — a curated, slot-indexed band. What it does not have is a family multiplexer. "AGNOS has no sockets" is false and must never be written.

🐧 On the host-bootstrap side, `CONFIG_SCTP=n`, `CONFIG_RDS=n` and `CONFIG_TIPC=n` are pinned (`kernel/6.6-lts/configs/agnos_defconfig:114-116`). ⚠️ **DCCP is not pinned** — the predecessor cited `CONFIG_MPTCP=n`/`CONFIG_NDISC=n`, which are both absent from the file and are the wrong symbols regardless (upstream is `CONFIG_IP_DCCP`).

### 4.1 System accounting (auditd)

**(b) Maps to a different mechanism — with a different tamper model.** There is no auditd, no `/etc/audit/rules.d`, and no audit rule language. AGNOS's audit substrate is **libro** (2.8.4): append-only, SHA-256 hash-linked entries with per-entry Ed25519 signing, Merkle inclusion and RFC 9162 consistency proofs (`libro/src/chain.cyr:108,253`).

✅ Shipped as a library. Be precise about what that buys:

- The chain makes tampering **detectable, not preventable**. `libro/src/file_store.cyr` is `flock`-guarded JSONL; on AGNOS every process is uid 0 with no MAC, so any process can truncate or rewrite it. Detection requires an out-of-band copy of the head hash.
- 📋 There is **no system-wide audit enable switch** and no remote log shipper (see [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) § *System Installation*). Today's writers are daimon and argonaut, not the kernel.
- ⚠️ The predecessor's `agnos-audit` package and `systemctl enable auditd` do not exist. Neither does the row claiming gnoboot passes `audit=1` / `audit_backlog_limit=8192` — those are **Linux** kernel command-line parameters, and gnoboot boots the AGNOS kernel.

### 4.2 Logging

**(b) Maps to a different mechanism, and only partly.** No rsyslog, no syslog daemon, no `/etc/rsyslog.conf`. Userland logging is **sakshi** (2.4.8); the kernel logs to the console. ❌ There is no log rotation, no remote forwarding, and no central collector — the CIS 4.2 intent is **not** met.

### 5.1 PAM

**(c) ❌ Structurally impossible.** There is no PAM on AGNOS: no `/etc/pam.d`, no `/etc/security/pwquality.conf`, no `faillock`, no `/etc/shadow`.

🐧 `zugot/base/linux-pam.cyml` is a Linux userland recipe; `aegis/src/pam.cyr` is Linux-host-only. **shakti** does real PAM auth via `unix_chkpwd(8)` — but shakti is **pre-1.0 (0.7.0)**, contains **zero** `CYRIUS_TARGET_AGNOS` guards, and hardcodes Linux `SYS_CAPGET`/`SYS_CAPSET` numbers. It is a Linux tool. There is no kernel seam behind it on AGNOS.

### 5.2 / 6.2 User accounts, UID/GID hygiene

**(c) ❌ Structurally impossible, and CIS 6.2.1 is inverted.**

`getuid#15` returns **0 unconditionally, for every process** — `agnos/kernel/core/syscall.cyr:7190`, inline comment `# getuid (root)`. There are no users, no UIDs, no GIDs, no `/etc/passwd`, no password aging and no login. CIS 6.2.1 asks that root be the *only* UID 0 account; on AGNOS **every process is UID 0**. The kernel says so itself in `core/power.cyr:338-339`: *"`getuid` is hardcoded 0 and there is no uid model, so a uid check would be a gate that is always open."*

📋 An identity and authorization model is a planning track ([`docs/development/planning/identity-and-authorization-model.md`](../development/planning/identity-and-authorization-model.md)), not a shipped control.

### 6.1 System file permissions

**(c) ❌ Does not apply.** `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/group` and `/etc/gshadow` do not exist, so there are no modes to audit. There is no `chmod` syscall and no permission enforcement path.

## AGNOS-native controls with no CIS row

These are the controls AGNOS actually has. CIS has no place to record them, which is itself part of why the mapping is thin.

| Control | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ring 0 / ring 3 separation; kernel pages mapped supervisor-only (`0x83`), user pages `0x87` | ✅ Shipped | `agnos/kernel/arch/x86_64/paging.cyr:7` · `core/proc.cyr:1007` |
| Per-process address space — a fresh PML4/PDPT/PD per process | ✅ Shipped | `agnos/kernel/core/proc.cyr:563-671` |
| W^X — NX on data segments, user stacks, and anonymous `mmap` | ✅ Shipped and **enforced** (⚠️ NXE is asserted by the APs but only *inherited* on the BSP, never verified — § 1.1) | `agnos/kernel/core/proc.cyr:1021-1046` |
| Port I/O denied to ring 3 — IOPL 0 and **no I/O permission bitmap** (IOPB offset = TSS limit) | ✅ Shipped | `agnos/kernel/arch/x86_64/gdt.cyr:82` · `arch/x86_64/ring3.cyr:181` |
| Raw block-device writes refuse until deliberately armed | ✅ Shipped, ⚠️ **anti-accident, not authorization** — the arm token is a constant published in the source and any ring-3 process may present it | `agnos/kernel/core/syscall.cyr:6802-6809,6836-6841` |
| Install-time package verification — SHA-256 root hash, Ed25519 signature over it, per-file content re-verify, then a trust gate | ✅ Shipped | `ark/src/ark_package.cyr:252-272,349-355,607-616` |
| — ⚠️ caveat: `require_signed` **defaults to 0**, so an unsigned `.ark` installs from a local path or any non-marketplace source. No config key parses it; the policy is code-settable only. The **one** path that forces it is a marketplace install, which sets it to 1 unconditionally — "always require a trusted signer (fail closed), regardless of the global default" | ⚠️ partial | `ark/src/types.cyr:342` (default 0) · `ark/src/marketplace.cyr:56-58` (forced 1) |
| Foreign-source hash pinning — fetch → verify → *only then* extract; fail-closed on a hash that is not exactly 64 hex chars | ✅ Shipped | `takumi/src/cli.cyr:274-289` · `takumi/src/source.cyr:201` |
| — coverage: 548 of 564 zugot recipes carry a `sha256`; the 16 without are all `local = true` (no upstream source). The parser refuses a remote source with no hash | ✅ Shipped | `takumi/src/parse.cyr:203-218` |
| Hash-chained, Ed25519-signed audit records | ✅ Shipped as a library (§ 4.1 caveats) | `libro/src/chain.cyr:108,253` |
| Build sandbox — netns hermeticity, Landlock write-confinement, group-kill timeout | 🐧 **Linux-target only**, and ⚠️ **self-declared NOT a containment boundary** against malicious recipes (recipes are trusted). Layers are best-effort: an unavailable layer runs the step *degraded with a warning* unless `--require-sandbox`. Known gap SEC-11 — a step that double-forks / `setsid()`s escapes the group-kill and outlives the build | `takumi/src/sandbox.cyr:1-33` |
| **KASLR** | ❌ **Absent in the shipped build** | see below |
| IOMMU / DMA restriction | 🐧 / ⚠️ **not active on the primary iron target** | see below |
| Confinement, MAC, per-process capabilities | 📋 **Aspirational** | `agnos/kernel/core/syscall.cyr:6804-6807` — the check lands "when agnos grows per-proc caps" |
| Signature verification at **exec** | ❌ Absent | `agnos/kernel/core/elf.cyr:19-30` validates ELF magic, 64-bit class and bounds. No hash, no signature |
| Secure Boot / measured boot / TPM | 📋 **Aspirational, post-v1.0** | `gnoboot/docs/development/roadmap.md:202-210,236-240`; gnoboot's `[deps]` is `stdlib = ["fnptr"]` — it links no crypto and verifies nothing it loads |
| Firewall / packet filter | ❌ Absent | No netfilter, nftables or filter hook in the AGNOS kernel |

**KASLR — why it is ❌ and not ✅.** The mechanism exists, but the image-base slide requires an opt-in `CYRIUS_PIE=1` build. That flag appears **nowhere** except the smoke script's own usage text (`agnos/scripts/smoke/kaslr-smoke.sh:7,26,29`) — not in agnos CI, not in `build.sh`, not in this repo's boot/ISO pipeline. `readelf -h agnos/build/agnos` reports `Type: EXEC`, and gnoboot slides only `ET_DYN`. The allocator half is independently dead: `pmm_next_free` is RDRAND-seeded (`agnos/kernel/core/pmm.cyr:535`) but no allocator reads it. **No address randomization is active in a shipped AGNOS today.**

**IOMMU — why it is qualified.** VT-d initialises only when an Intel DMAR table is present (`agnos/kernel/core/main.cyr:544-551`). On AMD, AGNOS **actively disables AMD-Vi on every boot** — `amd_iommu_disable()` writes the AMD-Vi Control Register to 0, "passthrough for everyone" (`core/main.cyr:471-478`). The primary iron target is AMD. **On the hardware AGNOS actually runs on, DMA is unrestricted.**

---

## Host-bootstrap kernel hardening (🐧 Linux only)

These `CONFIG_*` symbols are genuinely present in `kernel/6.6-lts/configs/agnos_defconfig` and were re-verified line by line. They harden the **Linux host used to build AGNOS**. ⚠️ **AGNOS has zero LSMs and no LSM framework** — do not read this table as an AGNOS posture.

| Symbol | Line | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX=y` | :21 | |
| `CONFIG_SECURITY_LANDLOCK=y` | :22 | kavach's Landlock backend targets this host, not AGNOS |
| `CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA=y` | :25 | |
| `CONFIG_SECURITY_SAFESETID=y` | :26 | |
| `CONFIG_SECURITY_LOCKDOWN_LSM=y` | :27 | |
| `CONFIG_INTEGRITY=y` | :28 | |
| `CONFIG_SECCOMP=y` / `CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER=y` | :66-67 | The real upstream symbols |
| `CONFIG_SECURITY_SECCOMP=y` | :23 | ⚠️ **Not an upstream Kconfig symbol.** A defconfig line for a nonexistent symbol is silently dropped by `make olddefconfig`; the working seccomp pins are :66-67 |

⚠️ **Known gap in this set.** [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) states that the host defconfigs pin `# CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API{,_HASH,_SKCIPHER,_AEAD,_RNG} is not set` to strip the CVE-2026-31431 surface from bootstrap hosts, and `docs/development/roadmap.md:72` lists that pin as a **Do** item. It has not been done: a search across all nine host config files (`kernel/{6.6-lts,6.x-stable,7.0-devel}/configs/*` and `kernel/configs/edge-*.config`) returns **zero** `CRYPTO_USER_API` lines. The AGNOS kernel's structural immunity is unaffected — it has no AF_ALG to begin with — but the **host** kernels do not currently carry the pin.

## Verification

⚠️ **There is no `agnos-cis-audit` binary.** The predecessor documented three `sudo agnos-cis-audit …` invocations; nothing by that name exists anywhere in the repo, and AGNOS has no `sudo` (shakti is the escalation tool, is pre-1.0, and is Linux-only). The nearest historical artifact is `scripts/archive-pre-cyrius/cis-validate.sh` — archived Rust-era bash whose helpers shell out to Linux `sysctl`.

📋 **No automated CIS auditing exists for AGNOS, and no CIS assessment has ever been run against it.** What an operator can verify today is the AGNOS-native table above, control by control, by reading the cited source. Supply-chain integrity has real tooling: `cyrius deps --verify`, `cyrius vet`, `cyrius deny`, and `scripts/check-dep-tags.py` — documented in [`vulnerability-management.md`](vulnerability-management.md).

## Summary

Of roughly 55 controls in the predecessor's mapping, **one family (3.4, uncommon protocols) maps in a way AGNOS satisfies — and satisfies structurally rather than by configuration.** Three families map onto a *different* AGNOS mechanism with materially different properties (time sync → kernel SNTP; auditd → libro; syslog → sakshi + console). The remainder presuppose uid/gid, PAM, systemd, sysctl, mount options or a distribution package set, none of which AGNOS has or plans to acquire.

The correct posture statement is the one in [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md): AGNOS is a **single-owner, single-trust-domain** OS whose security value is a radically small, sovereign attack surface that structurally lacks whole classes of Linux vulnerability — **not** the enforcement of boundaries between users or processes, which the kernel does not yet implement. A CIS mapping measures the second thing. It is the wrong instrument for this system, and this document exists to say where and why, not to produce a score.
