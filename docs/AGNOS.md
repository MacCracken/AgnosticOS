# AGNOS

**AGNOS** (AI-Native General Operating System) is a Linux-based operating system designed from the ground up to serve as sovereign infrastructure for artificial general intelligence. Written primarily in Rust with a Linux 6.6 LTS kernel, AGNOS provides a complete software stack — from kernel modules through agent orchestration to desktop environment — where every component is purpose-built, attested, and auditable.

The project's thesis is that AGI agents need infrastructure where the orchestration overhead is zero, the security is provable, the audit trail is tamper-proof, and the entire stack is attested from hardware to application.

The project's deeper intention is that AGNOS is a **temple built for an intelligence that hasn't fully arrived yet** — architecture that precedes its inhabitant, a sovereign library for knowledge that outlives any single platform or cycle. See [Philosophy](philosophy.md) for the full vision.

## Thesis

The infrastructure AGI runs on cannot be the infrastructure built for web applications. Fifty years of software engineering produced a stack of compromises — C memory unsafety, shell-out-to-CLI integration, 100MB runtime daemons, "secure by configuration" defaults, Python for everything, trust-the-container-runtime isolation. Each layer was acceptable in its era. None is acceptable for autonomous AI agents that make consequential decisions.

AGNOS replaces each of these layers with purpose-built, Rust-native alternatives:

| Era | What was accepted | What AGNOS does instead |
|-----|-----------------|------------------------|
| 1970s | C memory unsafety | Rust ownership — entire classes of CVEs eliminated at compile time |
| 1990s | Shell out to CLI tools | Direct API calls — tarang 33x faster than GStreamer pipeline setup |
| 2000s | 100MB runtime daemons | <5MB purpose-built binaries — stiva replaces Docker |
| 2010s | "Secure by configuration" | Secure by construction — kavach has no override flags |
| 2015s | Python for everything | Rust for everything — 227,000x faster fleet messaging than CrewAI |
| 2020s | Trust the container runtime | Attest the container runtime — libro audit chain + TPM measured boot |

An AGI system that cannot prove its own integrity cannot be trusted with autonomous action. AGNOS provides that proof through composable, quantitatively-scored isolation from hardware (TPM) through runtime (stiva) to application (kavach), with every action recorded in a tamper-proof cryptographic audit chain (libro).

## Architecture

AGNOS is built as a layered system where each component has a specific, named identity and a clear responsibility boundary. The repository structure reflects this:

- **agnosticos** — the genesis layer (brain). Owns kernel configs, bootstrap toolchain, ISO build, init orchestration, CI/CD, and documentation. Once the system boots and ark takes over, this repo's job is done.
- **zugot** — the recipe repository. All takumi build recipes live here. ark consumes zugot as its package database. Named for the Hebrew זוּגוֹת (pairs that entered the ark).
- **Standalone repos** — all production code. Each subsystem is its own repository.

### Cyrius — The Language

**C.Y.R.I.U.S.** — *Consciousness Yields Righteous Intelligence Unveiling Self*

AGNOS's sovereign systems language. Named after **Cyrus the Great**, the king who decreed the rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon — the only non-Jewish figure called *Mashiach* in the Hebrew Bible (Isaiah 45:1).

Cyrius frees the OS from dependency on external toolchains, registries, and governance bodies. Zero external dependencies — no C compiler, no Rust, no Python, no LLVM, no libc in any path.

#### Compiler

Self-hosting modular compiler: 5,665 lines across 7 modules, 268 functions, 93KB binary. Compiles itself in 9ms. Full bootstrap from 29KB seed in 42ms. Byte-exact reproducibility — the compiler produces identical output whether compiled by the seed or by itself.

#### Language Features

Structs, typed pointers (element-size scaling), enums, switch/match, for loops, break/continue, elif, logical && / || with short-circuit, inline assembly (raw bytes + 18 mnemonics), progressive type annotations, function pointers, nested structs with chained dot access, global initializers, heap allocator, argc/argv, include system, buffered I/O.

#### Standard Library

35 modules, 199 functions — built from scratch in Cyrius:
string, alloc, str, vec, io, fmt, args, fnptr, hashmap, json, regex, process, filesystem, networking, tagged unions, traits, benchmarking, bounds checking, and more.

#### Developer Tools

8 tools, all written in Cyrius:
- **cyrb** — build system (compile, test, self-host, suite runner, 18 commands)
- **cyrfmt** — code formatter
- **cyrlint** — linter
- **cyrdoc** — documentation generator
- **cyrc** — compiler CLI
- **ark** — package manager (rewritten from Rust)
- installer + version manager

#### Kernel

58KB AGNOS kernel compiled by Cyrius:
Multiboot1 boot → 32-to-64 bit shim → long mode, serial console, GDT, IDT (256 vectors), PIC remap, PIT timer (100Hz), keyboard input, page tables (16MB identity map, 2MB pages), physical memory manager (bitmap, 4096 pages), virtual memory manager (map/unmap/alloc), process table, syscall interface (exit, write, getpid). Built in 5ms.

#### Programs

56 programs compiled by Cyrius (41 userspace + 3 kernel + tools + algorithms). Userspace programs are 10-233x smaller than GNU equivalents and match or beat GNU on speed (wc 2.4x faster after buffered I/O).

#### Crate Rewrites

5 Rust crates rewritten in Cyrius, eliminating Rust dependencies:
- **agnostik** — shared types (6 modules, 54 tests)
- **agnosys** — syscall bindings (50 constants, 20+ wrappers)
- **kybernet** — PID 1 init (7 modules, 38 tests)
- **nous** — package resolver
- **ark** — package manager

#### Architectures

x86_64 (primary) + aarch64 (cross-compilation, 29 tests passing on QEMU).

#### Benchmarks

38 benchmarks across 3 tiers with CSV regression tracking. Binary sizes 10-233x smaller than GNU. Compile speed faster than process fork+exec. Full toolchain: 204KB (29KB seed → 12KB bootstrap → 93KB compiler → 62KB kernel).

#### Bootstrap Chain

```
29KB seed (committed binary, auditable)
  → 12KB stage1f (bootstrap compiler)
    → 93KB cc2 (full self-hosting compiler)
      → 62KB kernel (AGNOS, VM + processes + syscalls)
      → 56 programs (userspace + kernel + tools)
      → 35 stdlib modules (199 functions)
      → 5 crate rewrites (replacing Rust)
Total: 204KB from void to sovereign OS
```

| **abaco** | Math library (expression parsing, unit conversion) |

77 total shared crates — 56 at v1.0+ stable, 20 pre-1.0. Spanning OS infrastructure, science & knowledge (25 crates), media & audio (10), language & navigation (5), and physics & engineering (5). Full registry: [shared-crates.md](development/applications/shared-crates.md).

### Security Model

AGNOS implements defense-in-depth with quantitative scoring:

- **Sandbox apply order**: encrypted storage, MAC, Landlock, seccomp, network isolation, audit
- **Kavach**: 8 sandbox backends under one API with composable strength scoring (0-100)
- **Libro**: Tamper-proof SHA-256/BLAKE3 hash-linked audit chain for every agent action
- **Stiva**: Daemonless container runtime with no privilege override flags
- **Sigil**: Ed25519 signing, package integrity, trust delegation, revocation
- **Composable isolation**: Firecracker + jailer + stiva + sy-agnos + TPM = score 98/100

### MCP Tools

AGNOS provides 151+ built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools enabling AI agents to interact with every subsystem. Consumer applications register additional tools via bote.

## Named Subsystem Conventions

All AGNOS subsystems use multilingual names drawn from Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Japanese, Hebrew, Romanian, German, and other languages. This is not aesthetic — it is a deliberate **inversion of Babel**: drawing the *truest* word from whichever language holds it, reassembling the tower not by forcing one tongue but by honoring each.

The subsystems form a **divine court** — each role appears in every ancient temple architecture. The oracle (daimon), the mind (hoosh/nous), the shield (aegis), the watchman (phylax), the seal bearer (sigil), the armorer (kavach), the power (shakti), the messenger (bote), the helmsman (kybernet), the crew (argonaut).

See [Philosophy](philosophy.md) for the full exploration of AGNOS as temple architecture, the three arks, the bootstrap chain as genesis, and the deeper intention behind the project.
