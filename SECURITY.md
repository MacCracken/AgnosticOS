## Notable Hardening — Structural Immunity

The AGNOS-native kernel is **structurally immune** to **CVE-2026-31431** (Linux LPE in `algif_aead`/AF_ALG via `splice()`, disclosed 2026-04-29). The sovereign AGNOS syscall table has no generic BSD socket family, no `socket()` over arbitrary domains, no `splice`, no AF_ALG — the bug class is unreachable. AGNOS *does* ship networking, but as a fixed TCP/UDP/ICMP band with slot-indexed connections: `sock_connect`, `sock_send`, `udp_bind` and their peers are purpose-built and take no address-family argument, so there is no family to select. This is a durable property of the *shape* of the surface, not its size: the table has grown several times over as the kernel matured and the immunity holds regardless, which is why this section anchors on the absent families rather than a count that drifts. Re-verified 2026-08-05 in `agnos/kernel/core/syscall.cyr`; the live enumeration lives in `agnos/docs/development/agnos-userland-abi.md` and is deliberately not restated here.

This is the canonical example of the **absence-by-design** security pattern: the kernel doesn't *patch* the vulnerability, doesn't *contain* the vulnerable subsystem — whole categories of Linux kernel CVEs become structurally inapplicable. Linux host defconfigs in this repo (`kernel/{6.6-lts,6.x-stable,7.0-devel}/configs/` and `kernel/configs/edge-*.config`) pin `# CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API{,_HASH,_SKCIPHER,_AEAD,_RNG} is not set` to remove the equivalent surface from host kernels used in the bootstrap path.

⚠️ **Absence-by-design covers only the classes AGNOS never added — not the surface it does add.** That surface is tracked, not assumed. The GPU/compositor and shared-memory bands grew with the desktop arc; kernel-side modeset writes sit behind an arm-once on-disk latch (`/.modeset-armed`), and block-device writes refuse until deliberately armed — see *Defense in Depth* below for what that gate is and is not. Shared-memory slots gained an owner and a generation, with `shm_free` owner-gated, in agnos 1.56.40 — cross-owner *reads* remain permitted and counted rather than refused, because the compositor performs one every frame; that cut is open and has not been burned on iron. Current status: [`docs/development/state.md`](docs/development/state.md).

For more on the pattern, see [`docs/security/security-guide.md`](docs/security/security-guide.md).

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth

AGNOS layers security natively. ⚠️ **No layer below is a Linux mechanism, and none will be**: per [`docs/development/roadmap.md`](docs/development/roadmap.md), confinement "when it lands, is **capability-scoped and native** — never Landlock, seccomp or `unshare` ABI emulation." Naming a Linux primitive here would advertise something the project has ruled out permanently, so layers that are not yet built are marked 📋 rather than dressed in a borrowed name.

- **Kernel Level**: ring 0 / ring 3 separation with a per-process address space; W^X — non-executable ELF segments and every user stack mapped NX; KASLR — the PIE kernel image is slid to an RDRAND-chosen 2 MB-aligned base each boot. ⚠️ That is *image-base* randomization only: the physical allocators are deterministic by design (both were made directional to fix a boot-flaky page fault), so this is not heap or allocation randomization
- **System Level**: irreversible operations gated at the syscall boundary rather than by a MAC label store — raw block-device writes refuse until deliberately armed, and kernel-side modeset writes sit behind an arm-once on-disk latch. 📋 Per-process capabilities are **not** in the kernel yet; the block-write gate is a global arm token holding that seam open for aegis/shakti. 📋 Encryption at rest is installer-side only (agnova's LUKS root option) — the AGNOS kernel reads no encrypted volume
- **Application Level**: signature verification before *installation* — ark checks a SHA-256 root hash, an Ed25519 signature and per-file hashes (sigil) before any file is written — plus binary/archive scanning and auto-quarantine (aegis, kavach). ⚠️ Nothing verifies a signature at *exec* time: the AGNOS ELF loader performs no signature check, and per-agent capability grants are a design target, not a mechanism that exists today. ⚠️ kavach's Landlock / seccomp / namespace backends are **Linux-target only** — on AGNOS they compile out and report "not supported"; native confinement primitives are a roadmap item, not a shipped one
- **Network Level**: a fixed TCP/UDP/ICMP kernel band with slot-indexed connections, plus ingress hardening (a claimed IPv4 total-length is clamped to the bytes actually received). TLS is a **ring-3** concern — the Cyrius stdlib's `tls_native` over sigil — unblocked by the kernel prerequisites `getrandom`#45, `time_unix`#46 and `sock_*`#47–50. 📋 There is no in-kernel packet filter; a firewall layer is unbuilt, not merely unconfigured
- **Audit Level**: hash-chained, Ed25519-signed audit records (libro + sigil), with ML-DSA-65 post-quantum signing default-on in sigil
- **Structural Level**: Whole CVE classes unreachable because the syscall surface doesn't expose them (see *Notable Hardening* above)

### 2. Least Privilege

- Agents run with minimal required permissions — 📋 the intended model, and the design goal every item below is measured against. It is **not a control AGNOS enforces today**: every process runs unconfined, and the three bullets that follow name exactly where the gap is
- Capabilities are granted per-agent, not system-wide — 📋 the intended model. No per-agent capability enforcement exists yet: not in the kernel, not in daimon, and not behind the agent config schema below
- Identity is sigil keys, not Unix accounts — AGNOS is single-owner and does no Unix login by default. ⚠️ There is no uid model in the kernel today: `getuid` returns 0 for every process, so "restrict root" is not yet a control AGNOS can offer. What actually limits an agent today is signature verification at install and aegis quarantine — not a privilege boundary the kernel enforces
- Privilege escalation requires explicit authorization (shakti) — ⚠️ shakti is **pre-1.0 (0.7.0)** and authenticates against a policy file in userland. The kernel has no seam behind it: `syscall.cyr` records the aegis/shakti capability check as landing "when agnos grows per-proc caps", so nothing today prevents a process from simply not asking

### 3. Transparency

- All security-relevant events are logged
- Audit logs are cryptographically signed
- Source code is open for review
- Security decisions are documented

### 4. Human Sovereignty

- Humans retain ultimate control
- All agent actions can be audited
- Override mechanisms exist for critical operations
- No autonomous privileged operations

## Security Architecture

For the full security architecture, threat model, and technical details (process isolation, the syscall trust boundary, W^X, sandboxing, permissions, audit logging, aegis, sigil, post-quantum cryptography, mTLS, zero-trust), see [docs/security/security-guide.md](docs/security/security-guide.md). That guide — and the checklist, penetration-testing, vulnerability-management and CIS documents linked at the bottom of this page — was **rewritten 2026-08-05 for the Cyrius/agnos era** against agnos 1.56.40 / cyrius 6.5.7 / gnoboot 0.6.1, and is no longer a fossil. The Rust code samples are gone; Landlock, seccomp and namespaces survive only as 🐧 *Linux-target-only* mechanisms that [`docs/development/roadmap.md`](docs/development/roadmap.md) rules out for AGNOS permanently. Sandboxing, per-agent permissions, the human-approval gate, mTLS and post-quantum key exchange are now recorded there as **absent**, not shipped. This page states policy and summarizes; the guide carries a `path:line` citation into live source for every control it claims — where the two differ on a specific control, verify against the guide's citation.

## Security Hardening Guide

### System Installation

⚠️ `agnos-install` / `agnos-secureboot` / `agnos-audit` were Rust-era placeholder names — **no such binaries exist**. The installer is **agnova**; the audit chain is **libro**. Of the three items below, only the first ships today.

1. **Encrypt the root volume** — agnova's LUKS option, chosen at install time:
   ```bash
   agnova plan --device /dev/nvme0n1 --mode server --encrypt --verbose
   ```
   📋 The AGNOS kernel cannot yet *read* an encrypted volume, so this applies to host-staged installs. TPM sealing is unbuilt — agnova has no `--tpm` flag.

2. **Secure Boot** — 📋 no enrolment tool ships. The pieces that exist are gnoboot (a PE32+ EFI application) and `cyrius sign-efi`, which Authenticode-signs a PE for UEFI Secure Boot. Chaining them into a first-boot enrolment flow has not been built.

3. **Audit logging** — libro provides the hash-chained, signed audit chain the subsystems write into. 📋 There is no system-wide enable switch and no remote-log shipper.

### Agent Security

⚠️ Agent lifecycle lives in **daimon** and sandbox policy in **kavach**; `agnos-agent` is another Rust-era placeholder name with no binary behind it. The policy fields below are kavach's **portable** ones — deliberately not `landlock:` / `seccomp:` / `network_isolation:`, which are Linux-target fields kavach compiles out on AGNOS and which the roadmap rules out permanently.

1. **Create Restricted Agent**
   ```yaml
   # /agnos/agents/my-agent/config.yaml
   name: my-agent
   capabilities:
     - file.read:/home/user/documents/**
     - network.connect:api.example.com:443
   sandbox:
     preset: strict          # kavach policy_strict()
     network_enabled: false
     read_only_rootfs: true
     memory_limit_mb: 512
   audit_level: verbose
   ```
   📋 On AGNOS the resource limits and the confinement backend are not enforceable yet; the `sandbox:` block is honoured on Linux targets. 📋 The `capabilities:` and `audit_level:` keys are a Rust-era schema with no parser behind them anywhere in the ecosystem — they document the intended grant shape, not a check that runs today.

2. **Verify Agent Permissions** — 📋 not verifiable today. daimon supervises agent lifecycle but performs no capability check, and nothing else parses the grant keys above, so there is nothing for a verify CLI to report on yet.

3. **Monitor Agent Activity** — agent actions land in the libro audit chain. 📋 There is no follow-mode log CLI.

### Network Security

📋 **AGNOS has no firewall.** There is no netfilter, no nftables and no packet-filter hook anywhere in the kernel; an `nft` ruleset previously shown here described a Linux host, not AGNOS. Because the kernel exposes only a fixed TCP/UDP/ICMP band, inbound reachability is decided entirely by *what you run*, not by a rule table. The base system's listening set is small enough to enumerate:

| Service | Port | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| daimon (agent runtime) | 8090 | HTTP API |
| hoosh (LLM gateway) | 8088 | OpenAI-compatible API; binds `127.0.0.1` by default |

Anything else you install opens its own port and nothing can close it again — bote's MCP transports (`127.0.0.1:8390` HTTP, `:8391` bridge, `:8392` streamable, `:8393` WebSocket) and agora's telnet listener (`2323`) are the two you are most likely to meet. Enumerate the daemons you actually started; there is no rule table to consult instead.

⚠️ Three consequences worth stating plainly. A port is closed here only because no program opened it — that is not the same guarantee a default-deny filter gives. A compromised daemon is not contained by it, and neither is a second daemon you forgot you started. And where AGNOS is staged from a Linux host during bootstrap, that host's own firewall still applies and remains the operator's responsibility.

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Boot pipeline security checks
cd scripts && ./build/boot --test --kernel /path/to/agnos

# Subsystem security tests (in respective repos)
cd /path/to/subsystem
cyrius tests  # every .tcyr suite under tests/ (bare `cyrius test` takes one file)
cyrius fuzz   # the .fcyr harnesses under fuzz/
cyrius audit  # project sweep: fmt / lint / docs / tests / bench
```

⚠️ kavach's nine CWE-class findings (CWE-208, -116, -59, -276, -532, -88, -316, -190, -252) came from its **ADR-005 hardening pass**, not from fuzzing — an earlier revision of this file credited them to `cyrius fuzz`.

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Attempt privilege escalation
- [ ] Test sandbox escape vectors
- [ ] Verify audit log integrity
- [ ] Confirm the listening-port set matches the daemons you actually started (there is no filter to test)
- [ ] Test human override mechanisms
- [ ] Verify encryption at rest
- [ ] Test recovery procedures

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels

| Level | Criteria | Response Time |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Critical | RCE, privilege escalation, data breach | 1 hour |
| High | DoS, information disclosure | 4 hours |
| Medium | Security bypass, misconfiguration | 24 hours |
| Low | Documentation, hardening | 7 days |

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring or user report
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Limit damage and exposure
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
5. **Remediation**: Develop and test fix
6. **Recovery**: Deploy fix and verify
7. **Post-incident**: Review and improve

### Emergency Procedures

⚠️ **There is no incident-response tooling yet.** Earlier revisions of this section listed an `agnos-agent` / `agnos-audit` / `agnos-security` / `agnos-forensics` command set; none of those binaries exist, and an incident is the worst possible moment to discover that. The steps below are what a responder can actually do today, with the gaps named.

**Agent Compromise**:
- **Isolate** — 📋 no isolate verb. Stop the agent through daimon, which owns agent lifecycle and process supervision.
- **Preserve evidence** — the libro audit chain is hash-chained and signed, so a tampered record is detectable. Copy the chain files before anything else; 📋 there is no forensic-capture command that bundles process state.
- **Contain** — quarantine and scanning live in aegis and kavach. 📋 On AGNOS the confinement backends are not enforceable (see *Defense in Depth*), so containment is currently "stop the process", not "restrict it in place".

**System Compromise**:
- 📋 There is no lockdown switch. The blunt controls that do exist are the block-write arm (raw device writes refuse until deliberately armed) and orderly shutdown via ACPI S5.
- Report through the private-disclosure channel below.

## Compliance

### Standards Alignment

| Standard | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| CIS Benchmarks | 📋 Planned | **No certification is held and no compliance percentage has been measured.** The mapping in [`docs/security/cis-benchmarks.md`](docs/security/cis-benchmarks.md) was rewritten 2026-08-05 and *is* scoped to the AGNOS kernel — its predecessor marked ~55 controls ✅ against subsystems that do not exist, and those were removed rather than updated. Its finding is that most of the benchmark is **categorically inapplicable**: CIS presupposes uid/gid separation, PAM, systemd, `/etc/fstab`, sysctl, auditd and nftables, none of which AGNOS has. Rows that hold are marked 🐧 **host-bootstrap only** |
| NIST 800-53 | 📋 Planned | Moderate impact |
| Common Criteria | 📋 Planned | Target EAL4+ |
| FIPS 140-2 | 📋 Planned | Cryptographic modules |

### Certifications

Planned security certifications:

- **Common Criteria (EAL4+)**: Targeting government/enterprise use
- **FIPS 140-2 Level 2**: For cryptographic operations
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Hardening compliance
